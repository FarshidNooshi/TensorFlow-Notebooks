# TensorFlow Notebooks

This repository hosts my extra works and projects in the field of Machine Learning and deep-learning problems with the **TensorFlow platform**. the repository contains several folders in which each of them is for an specific course(or specialization) or project.

## TensorFlow Developer

This folder is for my works(assignments&labs) at TensorFlow Developer Coursera Specialization program and courses which I have taken for that specialization. below is the list of all the specializations and courses with their respective certificates That I have had.

## Seeds Dataset Classifier

This folder is for a classifier for the Seeds dataset from [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/seeds). the data is first preprocessed with standard normalization and then feeded to various architectures of neural networks to see the overfitting effect and learning curves.
for better understanding of the classfier **Tensorboard** is used to analyze the results of the learning, and other callbacks such as
early stopping is also used to compile the models. for pre-processing the data _Pandas_ library were used.

## RCV1 Dataset Visualization
In this project, we have used the RCV1 dataset to visualize the data. 
The dataset is available in the following link: [RCV1 Dataset](https://scikit-learn.org/0.18/datasets/rcv1.html) 
The dataset is a collection of news articles from BBC. The dataset is divided into 5 categories: Business, Entertainment, Politics, Sport, Tech. and the visualization is done with Self-Organizing Map (SOM) and K-Means Clustering.
