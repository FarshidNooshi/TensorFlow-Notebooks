You used the same techniques for data and model preparation and were able to get relatively good results in just 25 epochs. For practice, you can search for other datasets (e.g. [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.php) with more classes and revise the model to accomodate it. Try to experiment with different layers and data augmentation techniques to improve your metrics."
