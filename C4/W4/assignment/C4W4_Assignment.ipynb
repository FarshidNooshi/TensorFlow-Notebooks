    "Welcome! So far you have worked exclusively with generated data. This time you will be using the [Daily Minimum Temperatures in Melbourne](https://github.com/jbrownlee/Datasets/blob/master/daily-min-temperatures.csv) dataset which contains data of the daily minimum temperatures recorded in Melbourne from 1981 to 1990. In addition to be using Tensorflow's layers for processing sequence data such as Recurrent layers or LSTMs you will also use Convolutional layers to improve the model's performance.\n",
