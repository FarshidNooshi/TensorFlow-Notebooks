    "Your model is composed mainly of [SimpleRNN](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/SimpleRNN) layers. As mentioned in the lectures, this type of RNN simply routs its output back to the input. You will stack two of these layers in your model so the first one should have `return_sequences` set to `True`. \n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned in the [documentation](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/SimpleRNN#call_arguments), `SimpleRNN` layers expect a 3-dimensional tensor input with the shape `[batch, timesteps, feature`]. With that, you need to reshape your window from `(32, 20)` to `(32, 20, 1)`. This means the 20 datapoints in the window will be mapped to 20 timesteps of the RNN. You can do this reshaping in a separate cell but you can also do this within the model itself by using [Lambda](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/Lambda) layers. Notice the first layer below. It defines a lambda function that adds a dimension at the last axis of the input. That's exactly the transformation you need. For the `input_shape`, you can specify `None` (like in the lecture video) if you want to be the model to be more flexible with the number of timesteps. Alternatively, you can set it to `window_size` as shown below if you want to set the `timesteps` dimension to the expected size of your data windows.\n",
    "\n",
    "Normally, you can just a have a `Dense` layer output as shown in the previous labs. However, you can help the training by scaling up the output to around the same figures as your labels. This will depend on the [activation functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activation_function#Table_of_activation_functions) you used in your model. `SimpleRNN` uses *tanh* by default and that has an output range of `[-1,1]`. You will use another `Lambda()` layer to scale the output by 100 before it adjusts the layer weights. Feel free to remove this layer later after this lab and see what results you get."

That is because we want the model to have its last prediction to align with the last point of the validation set (i.e. `t=1460`). You were able to do that with the slower for-loop code by specifying the for-loop's `range()`. With the more efficient function above, you don't have that mechanism so you instead just remove the last point when slicing the `series`. If you don't, then the function will generate a prediction at `t=1461` which is outside the validation set range.*"
