    "It is a bit better than naive forecast. However, the forecasts look a bit too random because you're adding past values which are already noisy. Remember that the time differenced signal is also noisy so adding these raw past values can compound this problem. To remedy that, you can use a moving averaging on past values to smooth out some of this noise."
